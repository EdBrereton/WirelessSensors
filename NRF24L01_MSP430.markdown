NRF24L01+ and MSP430
====================

##20th Feb 2015

Enrf24 energia library works nicely. Have had sample app running with 2x Launchpads

Default pinout for MSP430 is below

    SCK		-> 	P1.5
    MOSI 	-> 	P1.7
    MISO 	-> 	P1.6
    CE 		-> 	P2.0
    CSN 	-> 	P2.1
    IRQ		-> 	P2.2
    
Pinout for NRF24L01+ breakout is below

    ---------------------------------
    				|	8	|	7	|
    				-----------------
    				|	6	|	5	|
    				-----------------
    				|	4	|	3	|
    				-----------------
    				|	2	||	1  ||
    ---------------------------------

    		1. Gnd		2. Vcc (3V3)
    		3. CE 		4. CSN
    		5. SCK 		6. MOSI
    		7. MISO		8. IRQ

- Successfully breadboarded basic circuit running off CR2032.
- Range of breadboarded example is greater than the distance indoor at SMI
	- No outdoor test performed because it was cold.
- Ordered components for more prototypes
	- 10 x MSP430G2553
	- 10 x MSP430G2452
	- 25 x 47k resistors
	- 25 x CR2032 battery holders

##Next Steps
- Breadboard a basic MSP430 and NRF24L01 running off a CR2032 battery
- Assemble a stripboard prototype(s) based off breadboard results
- Assemble a USB -> MSP430 -> NRF24L01 base unit. Can be combination of cheapo USB -> UART and stripboard for now. Maybe look into etching circuitboard later.
- Get working with temp sensor and get readings sent back with transmitter UID
- Look into getting a SVG based map with colors served off PI
- Investigate mesh routing with the NRF24L01/MSP430 combo.
- Design generic board with pads for MSP430, NRF24L01+ and on board antenna.
- Design generic board with pads for MSP430, NRF24L01+ and off board antenna.

##Additional Notes
- Logitech Unifying Reciever appears to use an NRF24LU chip which is another nordic 2.4GHz chip, and appears to be compatible with the L01(+) - be careful when testing at home. Don't want to annoy Gaby too much...
